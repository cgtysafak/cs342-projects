Nick "⁠nitr0⁠" Cannella's men claimed revenge against the Chinese team to stay alive in the last chance bracket.

 Liquid have advanced to the fourth place decider match in ESL Pro League Group D after dismantling Rare Atom 2-0 in the last chance bracket. The North American side came into the match with a chip on their shoulder after the Chinese team had sent them down to the lower bracket to kick off the tournament, but this time around the match unfolded in completely different fashion as Liquid and Rare Atom opted to switch up the map pool with Nuke and Mirage, a choice which ultimately helped nitr0's side claim victory on both maps.

Liquid are not through to the playoffs quite yet as they must face the winner of Spirit versus Astralis on Sunday for the final spot out of Group D. The North American side have struggled to perform since arriving in Malta and are by no means guaranteed to go through; Spirit already defeated nitr0's men in the lower bracket, and Nicolai "⁠device⁠" Reedtz always proved a difficult individual for Liquid to shut down in past iterations of their roster.

Rare Atom's run through ESL Pro League also ends following the defeat. They initially impressed with a one-sided win over Liquid and stole a map away from Natus Vincere in the lower bracket before losing the series, but couldn't maintain their upset run deeper into the event. The Chinese team can now turn their attention to the European BLAST Premier Spring Showdown from March 29 - April 2 and have the BLAST.tv Paris Major Asia RMR following immediately afterward.
