The Danes will play Liquid on Sunday at 21:30 for a chance to make the ESL Pro League Season 17 playoffs.

Astralis are through to the ESL Pro League Season 17 Group D fourth-place decider after getting revenge over Spirit, who defeated the Danes in the group's opening round. The Danish lineup needed all three maps to get the job done, conceding their pick of Nuke (12-16) before replying with hard-fought showings on Mirage (16-14) and Ancient (16-12).

Astralis now need to reign supreme in another matchup on Sunday in order to make it to the bracket stage, which runs from March 21-26, as Lukas "⁠gla1ve⁠" Rossander and company are set to duke it out versus Liquid at 21:30 .

The two teams, who used to be bitter rivals back in 2018-2019, haven't met in the server since the PGL Antwerp Major Challengers Stage in May 2022, where Nick "⁠nitr0⁠" Cannella's men prevailed in a hotly-contested two-map affair to eliminate the Danes from the Valve-sponsored event. The stakes remain high for the two teams in this upcoming matchup, with the winner picking up the last of 16 playoff berths and the losing team heading home in 17-20th place.
device narrowly led the server with a 1.32 rating versus Spirit

Astralis took Spirit to Nuke to kick off their series, a likely pick given the Russians had only mustered two wins across their past 10 outings on the map. The Danes prevailed in a back-and-forth battle for control to get the series going, using their weaponry superiority to climb to a 5-2 lead on the T-side. Pavel "⁠s1ren⁠" Ogloblin gunned down three in a stalwart hold of the A bombsite to get Spirit back in the swing of things, only conceding one more round for the remainder of the half to sport a comfortable three-round buffer at the side swap.

Andreas "⁠Xyp9x⁠" Højsleth flipped the script with a round-winning grenade kill at the outset of the second half, and the Danes jumped at the opportunity to regain the lead following a period of CT-side domination, 12-10. Alas, Spirit returned to their winning ways, a spree made possible by a momentum-shifting triple kill from Leonid "⁠chopper⁠" Vishnyakov and his AK-47 in the 23rd round. The Russian-majority troupe ended the map with a clean six-round chain to steal the Danes' pick 16-12 and force a visit to Mirage in the process.
